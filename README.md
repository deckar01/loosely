Smart input masks for regexes

![loosely-watch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3108007/57148023-66439700-6d8e-11e9-964c-0862a8a0ad2a.gif)

## Why?

You are probably already using regular expressions to validate user input.
Leverage those existing patterns to help users format their input instead of
showing them error messages.

## How?

Loosely parses a regex into a graph. Each node in the graph has a set of
characters that it accepts. Each time the user types a character, the graph is
searched to see if the text represents a path through the graph. If a node only
accepts one character, the search is allowed to insert that character into the
input. This allows required parts of the mask to be inserted automatically while 
the user is typing. If no nodes accept a character, the search is allowed to remove
it from the input. This allows a user's personal formatting preferences to be
gracefully ignored. The result is a robust input experience that adapts to the
data as it changes.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save loosely
```

## Use

Construct a `Mask` instance from a regular expression.

```js
const { Mask } = require('loosely');

const mask = new Mask(/\d \(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}/);
```

### DOM Watcher

Filter input as the user is typing into a DOM input.

```js
const input = document.querySelector('#phone');

mask.watch(input);
```

### Low Level API

`filter(text)` returns a string that at least partially matches the mask.

`validate(text)` determines if the text completely matches the mask.

`sample()` returns a random string that matches the mask.

```js
const text = mask.filter('1-800-555-1234');
// 1 (800) 555-1234

mask.validate(text);
// true

mask.sample()
// 8 (693) 906-1454
```

## TODO

### Assertions

Assertions are currently treated as normal groups. Any overlapping expressions
before a look-behind or after a look-ahead will produce invalid results.
Negative assertions are also treated as normal groups without negation, so they
will always produce invalid results. Please consider contributing any ideas or
code you have for this feature.
